# Counseling-Process---Linked-Lists
A mini project in C using Data Structures-Linked Lists
Me and my friend Abhinand.G made a mini project in C which is basically a small scale implementation of the College counselling process.
We have tried to mimic the TNEA(Tamil Nadu Engineering Admission) counselling process.
This mini project has many features like username and password entry, Rank displayer (using randomize() functions) for the given input marks, Priority list using linked lists for the given user choices.
